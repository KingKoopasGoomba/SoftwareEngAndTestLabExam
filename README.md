# Lab Exam - April 5th 2019

## Test Driven Development

The code from this project is to be part of an online music streaming service.
The Playlist class is to perform a lot of the functionality such as:
* Add a song
* Remove a song
* Get the current song
* Get the next song
* Get the previous song
* Move to the next song
* Move to the previous song
* Jump to an index in the playlist 
* Clear the playlist
* Shuffle the playlist
* Reverse the playlist

The test code is already written and outlines the functionality of the class. You will need to build out the functionality of a Playlist class.  

The goals to get as many tests to pass in the time given without changing the test code.Z

## Set up
* Navigate to https://github.com/amcglynn/SoftwareEngAndTestLabExam
* Click the fork button in Github
* Clone the fork to your computer
> git clone https://github.com/<your username here>/SoftwareEngAndTestLabExam.git
* You can work on the master branch for this exam

Some advice: When you get a test to pass, commit the code.
> git commit -a -m "Your comment in here"


## Useful classes
These classes may be useful to build out the solution. 

**ArrayList** - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html

**Collections** - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html

You do not have to use these classes and can design the program with different classes if you wish.

## Submitting your code
Commit your code
> git commit -a -m "Add your comment here"

Push the code to your fork
> git push origin master

Open a Pull Request from your fork to the original repo.
